<p>LoTI calculates a ticket's winning likelihood by checking it against every possible draw. The more draws it wins, the better the odds, the less time spent waiting and the higher the returns.</p>

<p>If your tickets turn out to be average or worse, LoTI's ticket generator consistently outperforms most other systems, providing better numbers for the future.</p>

<p>LoTI eliminates the need for blind faith. Now consumers can test their tickets, know how good they really are and make wise decisions for the future.</p>

<p>Supports most lottery types, either choose from a (short but growing) list or build your own to match your local lottery.</p>

<p>Completely standalone, all processing done on phone, no internet connection required!</p>
